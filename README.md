## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/electrocloud.git
cd electrocloud
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Lambda & S3)
- Set up an AWS Lambda function with `lambda_function.py`
- Create an S3 bucket and configure event triggers (optional)

### 3. Configure Glue & Athena
- Use `crawler_config.json` to create a Glue Crawler
- Run Athena queries from `athena/queries.sql`

### 4. Frontend (React App)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Make sure `.env` has the correct S3/Athena endpoints or API gateway URLs.

## 📈 Sample Athena Query

```sql
SELECT
    meter_id,
    SUM(consumption_kWh) AS total_consumption,
    billing_month
FROM electricity_usage
GROUP BY meter_id, billing_month;
```
